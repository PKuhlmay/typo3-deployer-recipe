# This is how I personally like to deploy TYPO3 projects

**tl;dr**: Treat this repo like a repo of .dotfiles: Fork, adapt, make it your own, use your fork

This is an opinionated recipe for how I personally do my TYPO3 deployments.
It is meant for my my personal use rather than being a generic recipe for any TYPO3 deployment.
It is therefore susceptible to change any time and there will never be a release.

In that sense [publishing it on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/helhum/typo3-deployer-recipe) was a mistake
and as of now the package is abandoned there now.

The only reason I made this repo public, is to give inspiration how it could work.

So my advice is: *Fork it and use the fork the way you like it to*
